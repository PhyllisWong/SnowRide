### Pitch
1. The problem
    - Not all people in the Bay Area have cars, and certainly not all people who
    like to go to Tahoe have cars.
    - Some people who do drive to Tahoe want to have help off-setting the cost of
    the drive to Tahoe, plus it is dangerous to make that drive alone.

1. How it is solved today
    - Snow Pals is a website that matches drivers and riders. The problem with this
    solution, is that is not used by very many people. This makes finding a match
    nearly impossible.

1. How we are solving it
    - We are developing a mobile app so that more people with be able to find matches
    to share rides to Kirkwood.

1. Benefits to our solution
    - The app can give you alerts to your phone when a match has been made. Since it is
    a mobile app, users are more encouraged to try the service.

### Who our audience is
1. Age: 18 - 35
1. Outdoorsy types who ski or snowboard at an intermediate to advanced level
1. Live in the Bay Area

### Challenges to content based design
1. Getting the content, working examples
1. Design can take longer as you get working content
1. Changes in content
1. Scalability
1. Misunderstandings in content

### Things to avoid
1. Navigation bar
1. Shadows
